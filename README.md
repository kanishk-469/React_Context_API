# Shopping Cart App Using Context API

### Context API (Context API: Carrier of State and Shared Values, State management module by React Team )

1. Create Context
2. Create Provider
3. Create Consumer

### Custom Provider Component

### Custom Hook for useContext()

## Limitations with Context API

1. Design for Static Content (Even i can use it for dynamic context in Small Applications)

2. Debugging is difficult
3. Perfomance issue
4. Re-renders of Context Consumer
5. Difficult to extend and Scale Application
